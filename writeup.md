**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

***Objective***

The objective of this project is to find lane markings by developing algorithms for autonomous driving. This is advanced lane detecting 
project since the algorithms should be robust enough in finding the lanelines under varying light conditions,curvature of the road 
itself,vehicles on the road , condition of the road etc., The left and right lanes are to be detected from center camera mounted on
dashboard of the vehicle using advanced computer vision techniques.The outcome expected out of the project is to output visual display
of the lane boundaries, numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position from lane center as displayed below.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
